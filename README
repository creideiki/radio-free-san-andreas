Radio Free San Andreas


What does it do?
================

Radio Free San Andreas extracts all audio from a PC DVD of Grand Theft
Auto: San Andreas. This includes all music, DJ chatter, ads,
background sounds and cutscenes.


What do I need?
===============

* A GTA: San Andreas DVD, naturally. Developed for the PC version, PS2
  does not work, and XBox is untested.
* OpenSSL and libvorbis.
* 1,2GB free hard drive space and ~150MB free physical RAM.
* A little-endian, at least 32-bit CPU.
* A C and a C++ compiler.


How do I use it?
================

First, compile it. You need GCC, libvorbis and OpenSSL. Run:

  ./configure && make

Then, use it. If you just want to dump everything, try something like:

  mkdir ~/GTA-SA
  mount /mnt/dvd
  src/extract /mnt/dvd/audio/streams/* ~/GTA-SA/ ./metadata.conf

The first arguments are the files to extract from. Then comes the base
directory to put the output files in, and lastly the file to read
metadata from. (getopt(3)? Wazzat?)

The files are extracted as they are stored, to allow you maximum
flexibility in processing them. However, this means that you cannot
listen to the songs immediately, since each song is cut up into three
pieces (intro, main, and outro) with several alternatives for intro
and outro with or without DJ chatter over the music. To assemble all
songs without DJ chatter, run the provided shell script
assemble-songs.sh, giving it the directory you put all the output
files in as an argument:

  ./assemble-songs.sh ~/GTA-SA/

Here's the list of files on the PC DVD and the radio station in each:

  audio/streams/aa        Police
  audio/streams/adverts   Adverts
  audio/streams/ambience  Ambience
  audio/streams/beats     Beats
  audio/streams/ch        Playback FM
  audio/streams/co        KROSE
  audio/streams/cr        K-DST
  audio/streams/cutscene  Cutscene
  audio/streams/ds        Bounce FM
  audio/streams/hc        SFUR
  audio/streams/mh        Radio Los Santos
  audio/streams/mr        Radio X
  audio/streams/nj        CSR
  audio/streams/re        K-JAH
  audio/streams/rg        Master Sounds
  audio/streams/tk        WCTR


Why would I want it?
====================

Because you don't want to pay extra for the soudtrack CD:s when you
already have the game DVD. Because San Andreas Radio [1] is way too
specialized to work for you. Because GTA SA Music Extractor [2]
doesn't extract anything but the music. Because neither of those tools
are free (as in speech, not as in beer). Because you want a tool that
you can modify until it does exactly what you want.

Who's to blame?
===============

Simon Elén reverse engineered the encryption.
Karl-Johan Karlsson wrote the code.
The metadata is mostly taken from San Andreas Radio [1].

Can I change the tagging format?
================================

Sure. The file metadata.conf contains artist and title information for
all the tracks in the game. Just change it with a text editor.


Where do I get it?
==================

The official distribution page is at

You suck. I can do this much better.
